WGL was established with two 10/13.5 MVA 66/22 kV transformers and contains outdoor 66 kV and 22 kV oil filled switchgear that was installed when the station was built. A 20/33 MVA transformer, in addition to the two original 10/13.5 MVA transformers, was installed in 2013. The condition of the two original transformers and the 66 kV and 22 kV assets has deteriorated considerably, and they now have an elevated risk of failure. These assets pose unacceptable safety, network security, environmental and plant damage risks from possible destructive failure. A project to address these issues is expected to be implemented by 2024, and includes the following key scope items: (1) Replace the four 10 MVA 66/22 kV transformers with two 20/33 MVA 66/22 kV transformers; (2) Replace the No.2 capacitor bank; (3) Install two new 66 kV circuit breakers to complete a fully switched ring bus. This project will address the asset failure risks due to deteriorated electrical equipment and provide some additional capacity to supply the station load. The total project cost is approximately $20.3 million. Alternative options considered include: (1) Replace the four 10 MVA transformers, and the No.2 capacitor bank, with like-for-like assets. This is a high cost, due to the number of transformers to be installed, but delivers less benefits than the proposed preferred solution because four like-for-like transformers would provide a lower capacity than two 20/33 MVA transformers; (2) Replace the No.2 capacitor bank and the four 10 MVA transformers with two 20/33 MVA transformers.

The project had the following key scope items: (1) Replace outdoor bulk oil 22 kV circuit breakers with new indoor 22 kV switchgear; (2) Associated protection and secondary system upgrades. Alternative options considered include: (1) Replace the two poor condition 66/22kV transformers and the 22 kV switchgear. This is higher cost option that was previously proposed. However, following more detailed assessment of the service level risk, replacement of the 66/22 kV transformers is not currently economic. This project was to address 22kV asset failure risks but will carry the 66/22 kV transformer failure risk. The total project cost was approximately $15.3 million ±30%. However, when preparing the RIT-D Draft Project Assessment Report (DPAR), the condition of the assets at Watsonia Zone Substation was reviewed using a new asset modelling tool.  The conclusion of this review is that the condition of the assets does not warrant remedial action during the current planning period.  Accordingly, AusNet will not proceed with the remainder of the RIT-D process in relation to Watsonia Zone Substation.  AusNet will recommence the RIT-D process when the asset condition at Watsonia Zone Substation warrants remedial action.",,Summer,0,0.0644,0.033
